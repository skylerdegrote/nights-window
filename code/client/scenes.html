                My name is Mailynn. Mailynn Addison Cooper. I'm the daughter of Steven and Jayden Cooper. I have a sister
                (Stephanie Ann Cooper) and two brothers (Colton Douglas Cooper and Martin Adam Cooper. My mother was
                taken from us but she's alive, I just know it! I believe she was taken to a different world. I believe
                she was taken back home. No one believes me, not even Jess. I'm writing this note because I don't know
                when or if I will be coming back. I think the world I'm going to is called Tasilan. I read about it in a
                book I found in a mythical-reading bookstore at the mall. If I do find a way back to Turk, I'm bringing
                my mother home with me. I'm not leaving there without her!

            Mailynn placed the ripped paper on the front step of the bookstore, under a rock. She hoped it would be
            found eventually. Maybe whoever found it would believe her.
