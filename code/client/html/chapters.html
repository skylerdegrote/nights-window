            Once Upon A Time there was a small school called Hill-side High School in a small, almost invisible town called Turk.
            In this town, a family of five suffered a terrible loss. A mother, a wife. Her name was Jayden. Jayden was a fine woman; one
            that every town woman envied. She was smart, kind, and beautiful. But she also had her secrets. No one knew Jayden; not really. She
            had one particularly dark secret that not even her family knew about. It was this secret that took Jayden from her beloved family.
            <br><br>
            Jayden was not from this land we call Earth. Well...she was but not from this dimension. On her 14<sup>th</sup> birthday, little Jayden
            found a portal to a new land, a new time and a new home. This portal never completely closed. She kept it with her at all times as a
            reminder of her real home.
            <br><br>
            Her whole life, Jayden never really truly fit in. She always felt that pull to go back to her own dimension. But one day,
            this new land she ran off to as a girl, showed he a path to happiness. A path her homeland would never have been able to give her.
            <br><br>
            "Forgive me, my lady, for being so blunt. But your smile truely lights up this entire room." the strange mn bowed. Jayden
            stiffled a blushed laugh as she bowed back to the man, "My name is Steven, what shall I call you, miss?"
            <br><br>
            "You may call me Jay," her smile grew as her cheeks became rosey again, "Short for Jayden."
            <br><br>
            Jayden and Steven fell in love and had such plans for a large family. But Jayden had not revealed her secret to him. She was
            afraid he would leave her and tell everyone she was crazy. After having their second daughter, and expecting twin boys,
            Jayden feared it was too late to tell the truth. He would leave and probably take the kids with him. The truth was, she had been
            lying to him from the start. She was living a lie. No one she cared about, no one in this realm, knew where she really cam from.
            <br><br>
            <strong>(NOTE: there will be more here. Any ideas?)</strong>
            <br><br>
            This story is about Mailynn, Jayden and Steven's second child, discovering her mom's true history and believing
            in the ways of her mother's land. With optimism and hope at her side, Mailynn may just find a way to bring her mother back.
            All she needs is for someone to believe as much as she does.

            "Mailynn! This is crazy!"
            <br><br>
            "Jess, this will only work if we all believe that it will. You have to at least try. Please?" Mailynn paused, "If it was your family
            that was missing, I would help you."
            <br><br>
            The two women joined their friends at the table. It had been exactly one year since Jayden was taken from her family. Mailynn and her
            friends, sat around the kitchen table at her childhood home, hand-in-hand.

            The flame flickered as the room filled with a cold breeze. Mailynn, her sister, her best friend and two
            close friends sat around the table hand-in-hand hoping that their chant would reveal something. Five candles
            spread out, one in front of each person. The lights snapped off and the candles each blew out as if by a person
            one-by-one.
            <br><br>
            "This is too much, Mailynn. I'm outa here!" The connection broke as Ayla took her hands from the magical
            circle. The light glashed back on and the room grew hotter.
