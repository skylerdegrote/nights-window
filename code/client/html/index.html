    <h1 align="center">Welcome!</h1>
    <h4 align="center">I'm live-writing my third book. The working title is "Night's Window" and I would like you to
        help. I'm live-writing this books with no intention of publishing. I would like this to be a project of
        collaboration. If you have any ideas,please send them to me by filling out the <a href="contact.html">
            contact form</a>.</h4>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        I'm still in the planning stages of the book, that is why this website is pretty blank at the moment. I would
        love your help to get it up and running! Anything and everything helps! I've written the introduction of the
        book and part of the first chapter. I'm still working on finishing the first chapter as well as finishing up
        planning out the characters. Please give me any ideas you have. There are no stupid ideas!
        I love collaborating about ideas as well, so eventually I will have a chat-room type of thing on this site
        or on the blog, but for now
        please contact me with either the contact form or via <a href="https://twitter.com/thenightswindow"
                                                                 target="_blank">twitter</a> or
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nightswindow/" target="_blank">facebook</a>.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        If you know something about web development and would like to give any feedback about code, webdesign or want to
        join the project,  you can visit my <a href="https://github.com/skylerdegrote/nights-window">github </a> page
        as well. Everything on the site and blog are coded by scratch. Please submit any feedback through the contact
        form.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
        Eventually this front page will have the description of the book. But as this site is brand new, I need to
        gain a community. As the community grows and more ideas flow through each of us, this front page will change.
