    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h4>I'm writing my third book. The working title is "Night's Window" and I would like you to help. I'm
        live-writing this books
    with no intention of publishing. I would like this to be a project of collaboration. If you have any ideas,
        please send them to me
    by filling out the <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>I'm still in the planning stages of the book, that is why this website is pretty blank at the moment. I would
        love your help to get it up and running! Anything and everything helps! I've written the introduction of the
        book and part of the first chapter. I'm still working on finishing the first chapter as well as finishing up
        planning out the characters. Please give me any ideas you have. There are no stupid ideas!
        I love collaborating about ideas as well, so eventually I will have a chat-room type of thing on this site
        or on the blog, but for now
        please contact me with either the contact form or via <a href="https://twitter.com/thenightswindow"
        target="_blank">twitter</a> or
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nightswindow/" target="_blank">facebook</a></p>. If you know something
    about webdevelopment and would like to give any feedback about code, or join the project,  you can visit my
    <a href="https://github.com/skylerdegrote/nights-window">github page as well</a>
